# DSA Assignment – COMP 202

This repository contains my solutions and assignments for the **Data Structures and Algorithms (COMP 202)** course.  
All programs are implemented in **C**, with a focus on clarity, correctness, and understanding of core concepts.

The repository serves as a practice space to strengthen my knowledge of fundamental data structures and algorithms such as **stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, heaps, and various sorting methods**.

## Repository Structure

- Each question is solved in an individual source file named:  
  **`prog_<question_number>.c`**
- Explanations and details related to each program are documented using Markdown files named:  
  **`doc_<question_number>.md`**

This structured approach makes it easy to navigate, understand, and review individual problems and their solutions.
